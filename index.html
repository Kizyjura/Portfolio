<h3>My Salesforce Journey 🌱</h3>
<p> During my time volunteering with a non-profit organization, I had the opportunity to work hands-on with Salesforce, 
specifically the Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP). I assisted the senior Salesforce admin with day-to-day tasks like data cleanup, 
customizing fields and reports, and helping team members navigate the system. It was a great learning experience that sparked 
my interest in CRM solutions and how they can empower mission-driven work.

Since then, I’ve been actively learning through Salesforce Trailhead, attending community events, 
and keeping up with the latest technologies. Right now, I’m preparing for Salesforce’s free annual 
certification — this year, it’s focused on AI for Salesforce Automation. I’d consider myself an 
intermediate beginner — not an expert (yet!), but I’m enthusiastic, curious, and always growing. </p>

    <h2>From Fire to Fusion: My Culinary Story 🔪🔥</h2>
    <p>I’ve been cooking for as long as I can remember — it started in my family’s kitchen, 
      where I first fell in love with food. After culinary school, grounded in the classic 
      techniques of Italian and French cuisine, I jumped straight into the fast-paced world 
      of professional kitchens.

Over the past 10 years, I’ve worked everywhere I could: pizzerias, restaurants, bistros — 
chasing inspiration, soaking up knowledge, and learning from chefs with roots in their native culture, i wandered in British, 
Indian, Lebanese, Chinese, Japanese, German, Greek, and Turkish traditions. 
Some of the most memorable of those experiences were thanks to my languages skills, which allowed me to connect with 
chefs and kitchen staff from around the world.
Every kitchen was a new chapter, and every dish added depth to my understanding of food.

From the bold spices of Indian and Lebanese cuisine to the delicate precision of Japanese and Chinese kitchens… 
from hearty German dishes to the vibrant flavors of Greek and Turkish food… 
every place has left a mark on how I cook and how I see food. And through it all, 
the heartbeat of Italian and French culinary tradition is always present in my approach.

I worked hard behind the flames, pushing orders out during hectic services, sweating through 
long shifts with diverse and passionate teams. Slowly but surely, I climbed the ranks, eventually
 becoming Head Chef — managing food costs, writing menus, and leading the kitchen crew. But with 
 the pressure came burnout. The passion that once fueled me started to fade under the weight of the daily grind.

That’s when I decided to break out of the routine and step into the unknown.

My first freelance job turned out to be a turning point: I was asked to learn and translate 
recipes from an English-speaking Japanese chef, and then teach them to an Italian kitchen staff. 
It felt like magic — combining my love for food, culture, languages, and sharing knowledge.


It opened my eyes to a new path — one where I could blend all my skills and passions in a way that 
felt meaningful and sustainable.

This is where I’m at now: still passionate about cooking, but also passionate about learning, teaching,
creating connections, and building something uniquely mine.</p>

    <h2>My Life in Sound 🎶</h2>

    <br>

    <p>Music has always been part of my life — I was lucky to grow up in a home where
      both of my parents played. My mother played guitar and piano, and my father was
      often found with a guitar, harmonica, or percussion instrument in hand. They
      were amateur musicians, but they passed on something priceless: a love for
      music and an ear for rhythm.

As a kid, I naturally picked up the guitar, and later — in my early teens — a family 
friend handed me a Roland MC-909 Groovebox. That moment was a turning point. 
I was instantly hooked. The world of electronic music opened up in front of me, 
and I dove right into sound synthesis, beat-making, and the hypnotic structures 
of electronic dance music.

It quickly became more than a hobby. I began producing my own tracks, playing at parties, 
and mixing my music into DJ sets. Over time, I mastered tools like Ableton Live, Cubase, 
and a few other DAWs. I also started collecting synths, drum machines, and quirky sound devices — the
 kind of gear that makes strange noises when you touch them. Honestly, it's like being a kid in a candy shop.
  ( Let’s just say, like tattoos or cats, you NEVER stop at one. )

These days (2025), life is fuller — I’ve taken on more responsibilities, and my time for gigs and studio
 sessions has shrunk. But the music hasn’t stopped. I still play piano and guitar, and whenever I can, 
 I carve out a little pocket of time just to create something, or simply sit back and listen. Because for me, 
 music isn’t just a passion — it’s a way of being.</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 I've produced under various names, including Oniric9, Kizyjura, Nataraja and others. . .

    <h2>From WoW to Gigs: My Visual Storytelling Journey 🎮📷🎬</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Like the true nerd I am, my first dive into video editing came from something close to my heart —
       recording and editing my World of Warcraft plays. 
       I’d spend hours clipping PvP highlights, adding music, effects, memes, transitions... you name it. 
       Back then, it was more about sharing epic moments with my guild than creating “art” — 
       but it planted the seed. It was fun, creative, and gave me my first taste of what it means to 
       shape a story with visuals.

At first, I didn’t think much of photography. I underestimated the power of always having a camera in your pocket 
(thanks, smartphones). But slowly, I started snapping photos and videos of something that felt more personal: 
my food. My kitchen experiments. The little details of something I loved doing.

To my surprise, people noticed. Friends started asking for help with their own video projects — a small gig here, 
an editing job there. Before I knew it, I was making content for businesses and organizations: interviews, online 
courses, promo videos, and more.

That first leap into freelance work gave me confidence and fresh inspiration. It helped me see how I could use these 
visual tools to tell real stories, not just my own. Even though my cooking YouTube channel hasn’t been updated in a 
while (guilty), the fire’s still burning.

Now, I’m ready to bring it all together — food, tech, creativity, and storytelling — into one steam-powered 
content-creating machine (me). My goal? To keep making things that matter, and maybe even break free from 
the rat race while I’m at it.</p>

    <h2>Sharing Knowledge, Building Bridges 🎤🌍</h2>
    <BR>
    <br>
    <p>My journey into public speaking and tutoring began in 2018, when I started working with a non-profit organization 
      focused on creating educational and cultural activities through European-funded projects in Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium.

At first, I supported from behind the scenes — editing course materials, photographing events, filming gigs, and helping deliver
 workshops to high school students in my city. 
 But over time, my role grew. I started participating in international events, where I presented our projects and represented 
 the organization at large venues and gatherings hosted by partner associations.

Today, I’m one of the tutors regularly leading workshops for high school students. 
I also assist professionals during upskilling courses — whether it's introducing new software, helping municipality staff 
learn digital tools, or supporting cybersecurity awareness programs.

Thanks to my language skills and a clear, organized communication style, I’ve also become the International
 Relations Assistant for the organization — helping bridge conversations across borders and keep projects moving smoothly.

This role has opened my eyes to new, flexible ways of working. I’ve learned how to coordinate remote teams,
 manage tasks through platforms like ClickUp, and keep people aligned and productive even when we’re spread across 
 different countries and time zones.

Public speaking, tutoring, and international teamwork have taught me not only how to lead, but also how to 
listen — and that’s something I carry with me in everything I do.</p>

    <h2>Language: More Than Words, A Bridge to Connection 🌐🗣️</h2>
    <p>I’ve had a special relationship with English since I was a kid. My father’s uncle married a man from South England, 
      and family gatherings quickly became a lively mix of Italian and what I’d call “broken” or maccheronic English. I 
      naturally stepped into the role of family translator, helping everyone communicate and connect.

Thanks to this early immersion, I had no trouble navigating the English-speaking internet of the early 2000s — which was 
huge for me, since I was already obsessed with video games. Most games, forums, and online content were in English, and I 
dove right in. From single-player adventures to LAN parties with friends playing Unreal Tournament and Halo, I was surrounded by English everywhere.

But it was when I found my way to World of Warcraft that my English truly leveled up. The game’s MMO environment forced me
 to communicate clearly and coordinate with real players from all over the world. There were no local-language servers — 
 English was the common ground. Leading and playing with groups of up to 40 people, all with different roles and skills,
  required teamwork, clear communication, and quick problem-solving to overcome huge, complex challenges.

This experience turned English into my main language by the time I was in high school, and it shaped both my hard skills — 
like fluency, digital literacy, and real-time coordination — and my soft skills — like empathy, leadership, and cross-cultural communication.

After years of traveling and exploring new cultures, I’m excited to keep making the most of my English skills, using them as a 
bridge for my projects and future goals. It’s not just a language — it’s a tool for connection, collaboration, and growth.</p>
<p>Besides English, I also have working knowledge of Spanish (B1) and French (A2), which keep me connected to more cultures and open up new opportunities to communicate and learn.</p>
<br>
<p> Right now, I’m diving into  new challenges: 
  <ul>
<li>Learning Chinese. Even though I’m still struggling to form full sentences and master the tricky
   tonal variations of this beautiful language, I’m putting all my effort and enthusiasm into it. but reading it is still a mirage </li>
<li>Upskilling my Frech from A2 to B2</li>
